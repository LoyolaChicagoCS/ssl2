	abstract = {Computer vision is often performed using Convolutional Neural Networks ({CNNs}). {CNNs} are compute-intensive and challenging to deploy on power-contrained systems such as mobile and Internet-of-Things ({IoT}) devices. {CNNs} are computeintensive because they indiscriminately compute many features on all pixels of the input image. We observe that, given a computer vision task, images often contain pixels that are irrelevant to the task. For example, if the task is looking for cars, pixels in the sky are not very useful. Therefore, we propose that a {CNN} be modified to only operate on relevant pixels to save computation and energy. We propose a method to study three popular computer vision datasets, finding that 48\% of pixels are irrelevant. We also propose the focused convolution to modify a {CNN}'s convolutional layers to reject the pixels that are marked irrelevant. On an embedded device, we observe no loss in accuracy, while inference latency, energy consumption, and multiply-add count are all reduced by about 45\%.},

	shorttitle = {Are You Really Muted?},
	abstract = {Video conferencing apps ({VCAs}) make it possible for previously private spaces — bedrooms, living rooms, and kitchens — into semi-public extensions of the oﬃce. For the most part, users have accepted these apps in their personal space without much thought about the permission models that govern the use of their private data during meetings. While access to a device’s video camera is carefully controlled, little has been done to ensure the same level of privacy for accessing the microphone. In this work, we ask the question: what happens to the microphone data when a user clicks the mute button in a {VCA}? We ﬁrst conduct a user study to analyze users’ understanding of the permission model of the mute button. Then, using runtime binary analysis tools, we trace raw audio ﬂow in many popular {VCAs} as it traverses the app from the audio driver to the network. We ﬁnd fragmented policies for dealing with microphone data among {VCAs} — some continuously monitor the microphone input during mute, and others do so periodically. One app transmits statistics of the audio to its telemetry servers while the app is muted. Using network traﬃc that we intercept en route to the telemetry server, we implement a proof-of-concept background activity classiﬁer and demonstrate the feasibility of inferring the ongoing background activity during a meeting — cooking, cleaning, typing, etc. We achieved 81.9\% macro accuracy on identifying six common background activities using intercepted outgoing telemetry packets when a user is muted.},

	title = {Snapshot Metrics Are Not Enough: Analyzing Software Repositories with Longitudinal Metrics},
	abstract = {Software metrics capture information about software development processes and products. These metrics support decision-making, e.g., in team management or dependency selection. However, existing metrics tools measure only a snapshot of a software project. Little attention has been given to enabling engineers to reason about metric trends over time—longitudinal metrics that give insight about process, not just product. In this work, we present {PRIME} ({PRocess} {MEtrics}), a tool to compute and visualize process metrics. The currently-supported metrics include productivity, issue density, issue spoilage, and bus factor. We illustrate the value of longitudinal data and conclude with a research agenda. The tool’s demo video can be watched at https://bit.ly/ase2022-prime. Source code can be found at https://github.com/{SoftwareSystemsLaboratory}/prime.},
