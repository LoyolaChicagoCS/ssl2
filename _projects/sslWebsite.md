## Introduction

To promote both the laboratory and research done by the researchers, faculty, and collaborators of the Software and Systems Laboratory (SSL), this website was developed. This website has been built several times. Once with the Python Sphinx library with the ReadTheDocs theme, and currently with the Ruby Jekyll library with the Al-Folio theme.
