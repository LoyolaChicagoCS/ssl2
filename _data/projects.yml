- projectName: Testing Effectiveness
  img:
  webpage: /projects/testingEffectiveness
  shortDescription: Testing Effectiveness is an effort to explore existing and new metrics specific to software testing over time. As a codebase grows, we hope that its testing code would also grow. Weâ€™re also interested in how existing metrics (coverage) correlate with classic metrics, such as defect density.

- projectName: VoltKey
  img:
  webpage: /projects/voltkey
  shortDescription: "The goal of Voltkey is to make the deployment and maintenance of new IoT devices easy. Currently, when we install new IoT devices, we need to go through a complex process of connecting the device to the WiFi network. With Voltkey, no configuration is necessary: you just plug the new device in and it works."

- projectName: Shape Analysis
  img:
  webpage: /projects/shapeAnalysis
  shortDescription: The Shape Analysis project is a collaboration between Loyola University Chicago, Louisiana State University, and the University of Connecticut that explores the performance of machine learning algorithms on the classification of fossil teeth in the Family Bovidae. Isolated bovid teeth are typically the most common fossils found in southern Africa and they often constitute the basis for paleoenvironmental reconstructions. Taxonomic identification of fossil bovid teeth, however, is often imprecise and subjective. Using modern teeth with known taxons, machine learning algorithms can be trained to classify fossils.
