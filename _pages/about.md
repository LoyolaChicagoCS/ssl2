# Software and Systems Research Laboratory {#ssl}

## > Hello World {#hello-world}

Thank you for checking out the Software and Systems Laboratory (SSL) website. We are a research laboratory based in the [Computer Science Department at Loyola University Chicago](https://www.luc.edu/cs).

Our [members]() form an interdisciplinary group with [faculty and student interests]() in Computer Science, Software Engineering, Information Technology, Cyber Security, and Engineering.

The laboratoryâ€™s focus is on researching computer systems and applied Software Engineering to solve STEAM-related problems.

## > Methodology {#methodology}

We foster innovation by encouraging experimentation and collaboration with a strong emphasis on openness. To uphold this commitment, we enforce [open-source software development](https://github.com/SoftwareSystemsLaboratory), open access, and dissemination of research software by creating reproducible results within all of our projects.

SSL embraces the notion that diversity drives creativity and innovation. We follow the principles of the [IEEE Special Technical Community on Broadening Participation](http://stcbp.org/) allowing anyone regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, socio-economic status, physical, mental, and cognitive ability, or LGBTQA+ status to join our lab.
